\documentclass[12pt,gsu,online]{gsudiss}
% The class file gsudiss.cls is based on the standard report class.
% The body of the text must be in font size either 11pt or 12pt.
% The option 'gsu' is for required line spacing.
% The option 'online' is for the online submission formatting, you should keep this option unless you are preparing a print version of your dissertation.
% You can remove the option "online" to produce a print version which has page number at the center of the footer by default. You can also add one of the options from {'', ''} for customizing the page number location. 

% There is also a draft mode option that can be used to print the word "DRAFT" (or other words defined in the following command) in the header of your dissertation. To enable this option, you can add the option 'drafts' to the class file. Just make sure you disable the "drafts" option before submission.
\printdraft{\textcolor{gray}\small DRAFT}    % In order to use this
                                   % command, you have to enable "drafts"
                                   % in the option of the gsudiss
                                   % class, otherwise it does
                                   % nothing. This prints the word
                                   % "DRAFT" in gray color in the header of your
                                   % dissertation. You can go wild
                                   % here if you want.
