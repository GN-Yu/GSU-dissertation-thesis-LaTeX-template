Some tasks:
1. Move `.sty` file to a folder? Or better just make every package being included as up-to-date ones
2. Separate the style of doctoral dissertation and master's thesis
3. Organize front matter in the file tree
4. Investigate "pnc" font
5. figures and tables format
6. check if he `\hspace*{1cm}` in front of both dedication and acknowledgement is the same as the document indent
7. An example of the two or more lines title
8. Investigate `\extraSpace` in `.cls` file
9. what a mess at committee member part!!!!!

Some thoughts:
1. The whole document can be a user manual. Instructions and examples can be written in the chapters.
2. Deleting `.bib` file most of the times solves the problem of bibliography. Not sure why there is problem

Examples and instructions include:
1. reference to chapters and sections, recommend, \chap\ref{chap:label}
2. citations
3. how to include figures
4. how to include tables

At release:
1. Change the typeout at release
2. Change the beginning of the main.tex
3.
