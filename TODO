Some tasks:
1. Move `.sty` file to a folder? Or better just make every package being included as up-to-date ones
2. Separate the style of doctoral dissertation and master's thesis?
3. 
4. Investigate `\mathbb` font, and if `\itshape`is the itshape of the normal font.
5. figures and tables format
6. check if he `\hspace*{1cm}` in front of both dedication and acknowledgement is the same as the document indent
7. Although it is mentioned in the guidebook that a preface is optional as the last thing in the front matter, there is no example so I did not write it in the template yet
8. Improper page number position for print version - both "online" and not "online" page layout needs adjusting
9. Ask the formatting team -- if the abstract takes two pages, should the dedication page be still numbered as "iv"? (In the template, it is hard-set in `.cls` file.)
10. Investigate the `drafts` option of the document
11. sort and annotate `FormatCustomizeOptions.tex`

Some thoughts:
1. The whole document can be a user manual. Instructions and examples can be written in the chapters.
2. Deleting `.bib` file most of the times solves the problem of bibliography. Not sure why there is problem
3. Separate "what you can customize", "what is recommended", and "what is required" in `main.tex`
4. Make a beautiful, customizable version for printings

Examples and instructions include:
1. reference to chapters and sections, recommend, \chap\ref{chap:label}
2. citations
3. how to include figures
4. how to include tables

At release:
1. Change the typeout at release
2. Change the beginning of the main.tex
3. Hide or remove `legacy` folder
4. Release both in `.zip` and as overleaf template
