Some tasks:
1. Move `.sty` file to a folder? Or better just make every package being included as up-to-date ones
2. Separate the style of doctoral dissertation and master's thesis
3. Organize front matter in the file tree
4. Investigate "pnc" font
5. figures and tables formate

Some thoughts:
1. The whole document can be a user manual. Instructions and examples can be written in the chapters.

Examples and instructions include:
1. reference to chapters and sections, recommend, \chap\ref{chap:label}
2. citations
3. how to include figures
4. how to include tables

At release:
1. Change the typeout at release
2. Change the beginning of the main.tex
3.
