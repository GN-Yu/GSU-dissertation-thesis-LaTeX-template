% Use this file if you have only one appendices. If you have more than one appendix, use Appendices.tex instead
% If you want to write multiple sections in the appendix, it's better also use Appendices.tex 

\chapter*{APPENDIX}
\label{chap:appendix}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{APPENDIX}

This is the appendix! You can actually have a ``phantom'' section in the appendix like the following and refer to it in your text like this: \hyperref[sec:appendix_phantom_section]{Appendix}.

\phantomsection
\section*{A section title in the appendix}
\label{sec:appendix_phantom_section}

However, you probably want to use \verb|Appendices.tex| instead of this file if you really have multiple appendices instead of separating phantom sections.
