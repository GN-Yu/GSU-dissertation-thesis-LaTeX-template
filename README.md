# GSU-dissertation-thesis-LaTeX-template
The purpose of this repo is to fix issues for the LaTeX template on https://cas.gsu.edu/thesis-dissertation-formatting and make it easier to use. We believe a good template will help the author better concentrate on the content rather than the format. This template is generally created for students from College of Arts and Sciences to write their Doctoral Dissertation or Master's Thesis. Note that this is not an official template yet, and the format should always follow the requirement from the university website.

Started May 9, 2024 from a bit newer version than that on above website from dissertation format review team on iCollege. (See the first commit after the initial commit.)

A good way to use this repo may not be forking it, because you don't want your dissertation/thesis to be public in the when you are writing it. Please download it as a `.zip` file to use it locally, and maybe upload to your own private git repo for better version control. But if you want to help make this template better, please feel free to fork, raise issues, or submit a PR.

Right now, I found many places that can be improved and changed. But my defense is coming up soon. I may not have enough time to refine this template.

Goal:
1. Minimal, as simple as possible
2. easy to maintain and update
3. annotated clearly
4. make "the problems I had" not "the problems you will have"
