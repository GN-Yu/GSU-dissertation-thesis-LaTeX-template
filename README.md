# GSU-dissertation-thesis-LaTeX-template
The purpose of this repo is to fix issues for the LaTeX template on https://cas.gsu.edu/thesis-dissertation-formatting and make it easier to use.

Started May 9, 2024 from a bit newer version than that on above website from dissertation format review team on iCollege. (See the first commit after the initial commit.)

The format should always follow the requirement from the university.
