# GSU-dissertation-thesis-LaTeX-template
The purpose of this repo is to fix issues for the LaTeX template on https://cas.gsu.edu/thesis-dissertation-formatting and make it easier to use. We believe a good template will help the author better concentrate on the content rather than the format. This template is generally created for students from College of Arts and Sciences to write their Doctoral Dissertation or Master's Thesis. Note that this is not an official template yet, and the format should always follow the requirement from the university website.

Goal:
1. Make "the problems I had" not "the problems you will have"
2. Annotated clearly
3. Easy to maintain and update
4. Minimal, as simple as possible


## Usage

A good way to use this repo may not be forking it, because you don't want your dissertation/thesis to be public in the when you are writing it. Please download it as a `.zip` file to use it locally, and maybe upload to your own private git repo for better version control. But if you want to help make this template better, please feel free to fork, raise issues, or submit a PR.

## A tip

* If there is an compiling error message about the bibliography and you can not identify the problem, try deleting `.bbl` file and recompile. (It could be always useful to delete all auxiliary files and recompile when you have an error that doesn't go away.)

## A very rough version history

I believe this GSU Thesis/Dissertation LaTeX template was first developed for the College of Arts & Sciences, Georgia State University, by Varendra Das, for his graduation during the Summer, 2006. It must have experienced many editions by generations of GSU graduates or formatting teams.

The current version is based on a bit newer version than that on above website received May 9, 2024 from dissertation formatting review team on iCollege. (See the first commit after the initial commit.)

The current version is a side product of writing my own dissertation written up in June 2024. I edited it more to fix issues and to make it more user-friendly. Right now, there are still many places that can be improved. But I may not have enough time to refine it to perfect. So you are very welcome to collaborate and make it better if you want when you are writing your thesis or dissertation.

## Notes

This file does not guarantee the satisfaction of all requirements specified by the College of Arts and Sciences, Georgia State University. Styles change on a yearly basis and it is up to you (the writer or author) to follow all the guidelines specified in the ``Thesis/Dissertation Formatting Guidebook'' for the College of Arts and Sciences, and any other formatting or requirements specified by your department.

Moreover, it is by no means applicable to the entire Georgia State System. Those of you who want to use LaTeX to prepare your dissertation, and who are not from the College of Arts & Sciences, however, can use this template as a guide to make their own. This template is developed to allow a wide range of formatting options, but users should bare in mind that the dissertation guide allows limited formatting, other than that which is used by
default.
